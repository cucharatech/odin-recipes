This is my first web project in the Odin Project Curriculum

In the first stage of the project, I will demonstrate the use of html for the structure and content of the web. At this stage it will only look as a "brutal web" without any tyoe of styling.
Nonetheless, the structure and hyoerlinks must work correctly. 

Later in the curriculum, I will come back and apply my knowledge in CSS for styling it. This will be stage 2. At the end, this project must be beautiful.

Thanks for visiting my work.
